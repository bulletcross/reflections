When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Sometime its convinient to work from different places and on different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Its not really required to always remain in sync with cloud because it costs us
    internet data. Interne may not be available all the time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: Makes a copy of project on github account from anothers github accout. Github tracks its record
    Clones: From Github account to local repo, or from local to local(different repo)
    Branches: From local to local but in same repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It may help to get an idea what was the last time we were in sync with cloud.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    By mailing another person about every changes i made. Easier to remain in contact
    with other person and harder as there would be much overhead.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Seperate changes have to be made if there is some conflicts.
